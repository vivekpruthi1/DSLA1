# Mushroom project
This project intends to apply various data science prediction models to test the mushroom data to predict the poisonousness of mushrooms.This project is an attemt to Classify different mushrooms as poisonous or non poisonous
based on the different machine learning models applied to data. I started with the exploratory data analysis to understand the data better and then applied different machine learning models to the data to do predictions. In the end we compared the models
to finally identify the best model of choice.
